    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 5px 60px 30px 60px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    bottom: -155px;
    background: var(--intro-email-bg);

}

--css grid sample

.main-content {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    gap: 95px 100px; 
    margin: 100px 0;
    padding: 0 200px;
    align-content: center;
    justify-items: center;

}
